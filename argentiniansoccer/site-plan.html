        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This page will explain the history of the San Lorenzo Club, how it was created, and the motives the founders had to create it. The page will also explain the different locations that the stadium had and why they had to move it. It will explain the various capacities the stadium had and the expansion. They also will find information about the costs of the tickets for the different matches and the explanation of the different sectors of the stadium along with the better places to enter. This page will call the attention with the simpleness of the design but the complete information. This page is intended to call the attention of all the fans and people that follow this soccer club. It is intended for all ages, but more centered in people between 15 and 45 years, just because they are used to computers and the internet.

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        This second page it is intended to call the attention to people from ages 20 to 45. This will explain more about the team itself. It will show more about the players and the position where they play. It will show physical information about the team, like the players high and their age. Some of the stats, like who has scored more goals, or who has received more yellow cards, or what goalkeeper had saved more situations.

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        This third page will be more centered in the young followers. The older ones will remember the different tournaments that the club have won over the years. They will remember the players, the goals and games of those tournaments. But the younger ones wonâ€™t know about them. The site should be a simple page. At the beginning it will explain the format of the competition and the season of the year when it was played. There are some competitions that stopped and they have been replaced by other formats or new competitions. The most important tournaments are the international ones, so the attention of the users should be directed to those reports, but also a year-to-year explanation of the local tournaments the club won.
