            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>At the beginning of 1907, a group of enthusiastic youngsters led by Federico Monti and Antonio Scaramusso spent hours and hours playing soccer at the intersection of México and Treinta y Tres Orientales streets. That's where "Los Forzosos de Almagro" was born, as they called themselves, with a motto that said: "You have to break everything to defeat us." The history of this gang would take a divine turn thanks to the social vision of Lorenzo Bartolomé Martín Massa, the Salesian father who sought to get the boys out of the dangers of the street. How did he do it? Opening the doors of the San Antonio Oratory so that the kids could practice sports in exchange for ensuring their presence at mass on Sundays. Thus, on April 1, 1908, after an extraordinary assembly, the club was renamed San Lorenzo de Almagro.</p>
            <h1>First Stadium: El Viejo Gasometro</h1>
            <p>
                It opened in 1916, which had the world at war, Albert Einstein publishing his Theory of Relativity. The Avenida La Plata Gasometer could hold more than 75,000 spectators. A symbol of the neighborhood, he had his soccer baptism on May 7 of that year, when San Lorenzo beat Estudiantes 2-1. El Gasómetro (a nickname that replaced any official name and whose origin has to do with its similarity to the gas deposits of that time) was the venue for the Copa América in its editions of 1929, 1937 and 1946. Its last match was played there in 1979 (a goalless draw against Boca) and the latent dream is that, in a short time, the ball will roll again on that property. "We will return," promises the people of San Lorenzo. And so it will be, to the excitement of millions around the world.

            <h1>The Second Stadium: El Nuevo Gasometro</h1>
            <p>
                The dream of having his own house, after the closure of the Avenida La Plata stadium in 1979, had become an obsession. We had to wait 14 years between that painful goodbye and the inauguration of Pedro Bidegain (in honor of a leader of the 20's and 30's). The Bidegain, baptized in December 1993 and whose playing field is the largest in the First Division, already knows Barça glory: the champions of 1995, 2001, 2007 and 2013 were consecrated there, in addition to witnessing the three coronations club internationals: Mercosur 2001, Sudamericana 2002 and the long-awaited Copa Libertadores 2014. Also at the Nuevo Gasómetro, San Lorenzo achieved the record of 13 consecutive victories, beating Boca 1-0 in 2001. That mark still remains unbeaten in soccer Argentinian.
